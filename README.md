### Key Features:

Input Parameters: Users can adjust health parameters like pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.
Prediction: The app predicts diabetes status based on the input parameters.
Confusion Matrix: A dynamically updating confusion matrix that changes based on a user-defined threshold.
Evaluation Metrics: Real-time display of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score metrics.
AUC-ROC Curve: A plot of the AUC-ROC curve with the best threshold value marked.


### Technologies Used:

Streamlit: For creating the interactive web application.
Scikit-Learn: For training and tuning the machine learning models.
Seaborn & Matplotlib: For visualizing the data and model performance.


### Repository Highlights:

Input Sliders: Intuitive sliders for users to input their health information.
